                The Everlasting Dragon
                <br><br>
                As you approach the castle, you feel the ground begin to shake. Townsfolk scream and flee to their homes, and ignore your calls asking what's happening.
                <br>
                Suddenly, the entire area goes dark, and you look up to see an enormous shadow blotting out the sun. A terrible, ear-splitting screech fills your mind, and you are knocked over by intense shockwaves as something enormous lands with a booming crash between you and the castle. 
                <br>
                As you stumble back to your feet, the stone courtyard quakes and cracks under the weight of the horrible creature crouching before you. A gargantuan black dragon furls and unfurls its wings, steam billows from it's flaring nostrils. An ominous hiss begins to slide from its jaws as evil red eyes fix upon you hungrily.
                <br><br>
                Your journey in this strange new land has all been leading to this moment. Are you ready to take on this evil?
